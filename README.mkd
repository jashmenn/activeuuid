# activeuuid

Add `binary(16)` UUIDs to ActiveRecord.

## Example

### Create a Migration

`activeuuid` adds the `uuid` type to your migrations. Example:

```ruby
class CreateEmails < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :emails, :id => false  do |t|
      t.uuid :id, :primary_key => true
      t.uuid :sender_id  # belongs_to :sender

      t.string :subject
      t.text :body

      t.timestamp :sent_at
      t.timestamps
    end
    add_index :emails, :id
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :emails
  end
end
```

### include ActiveUUID::UUID in your model

```ruby
class Email < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActiveUUID::UUID
  belongs_to :sender
end
```

### use it:
Here are some example specs:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe Email do

  context "when using uuid's as keys" do
    let(:guid) { "1dd74dd0-d116-11e0-99c7-5ac5d975667e" }
    let(:email) { Fabricate :email }

    it "the id guid should be equal to the uuid" do
      email.id.to_s.should eql(guid)
    end

    it "should be able to find an email by the uuid" do
      Email.find(guid).id.to_s.should == guid
    end

  end
end
```

## Motivation

From [2]:

> [Here is a] UUID:  1e8ef774-581c-102c-bcfe-f1ab81872213
>
> A UUID like the one above is 36 characters long, including dashes.  If you store this VARCHAR(36), you're going to decrease compare performance dramatically.  This is your primary key, you don't want it to be slow.
>
> At its bit level, a UUID is 128 bits, which means it will fit into
> 16 bytes, note this is not very human readable, but it will keep
> storage low, and is only 4 times larger than a 32-bit int, or 2
> times larger than a 64-bit int.

Many of the existing examples of how to use UUIDs as primary keys
in Rails use strings rather than bytes (e.g. [3]).

However, this plugin stores the primary keys as bytes. To the
application the keys are represented by a UUIDTools::UUID object.

## Benefits of UUIDs as primary key

* no id conflict during multi-master write
* no locking due to auto-increment
* with time-based UUIDs you can store a timestamp within your UUID
* you can create natural keys (based on the SHA of model attributes)

## Future work
* more transparent support for natural and composite keys
* support for MySQLs `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` syntax
* support a primary column name other than `id`
* tests

## Inspiration
James Golick's `friendly` is a great gem for NoSQL on MySQL. It's
a great gateway drug to systems like Cassandra for teams that are
already familiar with the ins-and-outs of MySQL.

## Installation
